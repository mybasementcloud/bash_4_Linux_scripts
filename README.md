        # download the repository
        sudo git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/mybasementcloud/bash_4_Linux_scripts.git bash_4_Linux_scripts
        
        # for Ubuntu
        cd ./bash_4_Linux_scripts/scripts/ubuntu/setup_scripts.ubuntu
        cat ubuntu_enable.instructions.bash

        # for RHEL
        cd ./bash_4_Linux_scripts/scripts/rhel/setup_scripts.rhel
